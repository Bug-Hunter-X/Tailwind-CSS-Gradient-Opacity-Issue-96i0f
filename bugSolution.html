```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-transparent to-purple-500/50 p-4">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
Adding `via-transparent` can resolve the issue in many cases. This ensures that there is a smooth transition from the first color to the final color which includes opacity.  Alternatively, consider using a different approach to achieve the desired effect, such as applying opacity to a container element instead of directly to the gradient.
