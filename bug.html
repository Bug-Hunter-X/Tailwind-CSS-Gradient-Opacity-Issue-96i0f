```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS's gradient functionality. However, if the `to-purple-500` is replaced with `to-purple-500/50` (to add opacity), it might not render as expected in some browsers or versions of Tailwind CSS.
